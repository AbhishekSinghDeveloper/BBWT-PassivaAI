        Use tabs to alternate between attributes belonging to, or strongly

        E.g. Imagine that your "reports" have a set of "parameters" associated
        with each report, i.e. a parameter "Ordering Company" is a filter for
        the "Banana Orders" report. The reports also have a set of "report
        users" that are allowed to view any report, i.e. "John Smith" is allowed
        to see any of the reports. Note that "report users" are associated with
        "reports" in general, not one particular report. In this case, your Edit
        Report page might have a tab for parameters, but it should not have a
        tab for the report users. Instead, there should be a "Manage Report
        Users" page.

            family, overseeshis daughter's wedding. His beloved son ichael has
            just come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of
            his father's business. T hrough Michael's life the nature of the
            family business becomes clear. The business of the family is just
            like the head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give
            respect, but given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands
            against the good of the family.

        <p-tabPanel header="Godfather II" rte="Fp">
            Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his
            landmark 1972 film, The_Godfather parallels the young Vito
            Corleone's rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening
            The_Godfather's depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In
            the early 1900s, the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for
            America after the local Mafia kills his family. Vito struggles to
            make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and growing brood
            in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci after he
            demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone,
            Vito's communal stature grows.

            After a break of more than 15 years, director Francis Ford Coppola

            passed, and crime kingpin Michael Corleone, now divorced from his
            wife Kay has nearly succeeded in keeping his promise that his family
            would one day be completely legitimate.
